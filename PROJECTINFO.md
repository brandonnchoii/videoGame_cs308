# videoGame_cs308

This is the copied repository of the my first project in CS 308: Software Design and Implementation.

I learned and utilized JavaFX in one week to create this simple flash game. There was an emphasis on efficient design and clean code by avoiding [code smells](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/bad-smells-in-code).

See game's README and DESIGN documents for further information.
