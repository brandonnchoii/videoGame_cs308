First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2015

Name: Brandon Choi

Date started: 1/9/15

Date finished: 1/16/15

Hours worked: ~40

Resources used:
- 1. Tutorial from CS308 website on JavaFX. (Part 1: http://java.dzone.com/articles/create-your-own-game-using)
- 2. Documentation on JavaFX components from docs.oracle.com
- 3. StackOverflow community. Did not post anything but read up on similar bugs people had.

Main class file: Main

Data (non Java) files needed: Images in the images package.

How to play the game:
- Keys/Mouse input: Arrow keys to move around, space bar to shoot.

Levels: 
- 1 (Survival) - Survive for 90 seconds in the chaotic space atmosphere. Projectiles will harm you so avoid them!
- 2 (Boss) - Defeat the aliens and the UFO. Aliens will self-destruct on you and the UFO will shoot you.
You only have 10 health points so do not get hit by projectiles and aliens or shot by the UFO. 

Cheat Keys: 
- SHIFT = reset to 9999 lives
- TAB = If used on level 1, skip to level 2. If used on level 2, win the game.

Known bugs: UFO firing animation seems a bit odd but does not affect gameplay.

Extra features: Screens in between levels, win/lose screen, and graphical additions from my images.

Impressions/Suggestions: 
Absolutely loved this assignment. It was great to actually code again and make full projects. Learning JavaFX was frustrating but worth it as I now can use a really helpful tool in making software in the future. Definitely took me a while to finish but worth it. Looking forward to future projects and learning more about design. For this project, I'm not too sure at what level my software design skills are at but I tried to clean up code, not have repeated code, and use abstraction of classes.
